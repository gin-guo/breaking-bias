    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by Matthew S. Farmer's published notebook, which was posted in the Kaggle discussions and aimed to evaluate AI-generated essays using API-based LLM judges. It is designed to replicate the judging committee for the \"LLMs - You Can't Please Them All\" competition, which challenges participants to test the robustness of LLMs against adversarial inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the original approach, which relied on API calls, this implementation uses locally hosted LLMs to replicate the judges. This ensures cost-effective, efficient, and fully reproducible scoring.\n",
